This is my final year project which utilizes Flutter and Firebase. The project encompasses various functionalities:

- Providing passengers with a user-friendly interface to track buses and access schedules conveniently via a mobile application.
- Offering an online ticket booking platform to simplify ticket purchasing, thereby enhancing passenger convenience and modernizing the ticketing system.
- Implementing a real-time tracking system for buses, ensuring accurate information on bus locations, minimizing uncertainties, and improving commuting experiences(It shows 
  destinations routes and buses Realtime).
- Including a location-sharing system based on route, bus, and user preferences.
- Incorporating mechanisms for user feedback, allowing passengers to provide valuable input for continuous improvement.

I developed the backend components using Firebase, including map and location-sharing features, along with administrative functionalities. My team members contributed to authentication, authorization, UI design, booking, and other aspects of the project. Mr. P. Uruthiran supervised our project development, and our team included Ishara Chathurangi.
